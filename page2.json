Vi jobbar för FNs globala om socialt ansvarstagande och finansiellt inkluderande. Vi fokuserar på att hjälpa unga vuxna in på bostadsmarknaden. Enabler har utvecklat ett anpassat framåtblickande kreditregelverk som fokuserar på anställningsbarhet och potential istället för historisk lön (som traditionella banker) och kan därför låna ut lite mer och med lägre egen kontantinsats. Skillnaden blir att en ung vuxen kan köpa en etta i Stockholms innerstad med en lön om 27,500kr/mån och utan krav på kontantinsats till skillnad från en traditionell bank där kravet blir närmare 42,000kr/mån och en egen insats på över 400,000kr vilket nästan ingen ung vuxen har hunnit spara ihop själv. Med 30-års kö på ett förstahandskontrakt och en andrahandshyra på i genomsnitt 17,000kr/mån är vår lösning flera gånger billigare än andra alternativ.\n\nVill du vara med och göra skillnad och kanske själv ta dig in på bostadsmarknaden?
